                <h3>- The dance world is full of<em class="no-border">styles, people, and ideas</em>- </h3>
                
                    <p>Dance styles each have their own stories, competitions, rules, and variations. 
                        <br> Breakdance began with hip hop!
                        <br> Ballet began with court dances for a king who liked dance.
                        <br> However, it's more complex than that!
                    </p>

                    <p>Dancers can do a wide range of things, like content creation, competitions, and taking classes at studios</p>

                <h3>- Dancers will work very hard to perfect their craft and make themselves stronger, faster, and cooler</h4>

                    <p>A dancer will learn new skills from other styles, and learn choreography from other dancers to improve.
                        <br> Breakdancers will use acrobatic skills and jazz dancers will get groovy in their own way. 
                        <br> both styles require high energy, confidence, and willingness to perform and not just move!
                    </p>

                <h2>- Most dancers will develop their own<em class="no-border">style</em> through improvisation</h2>
